            I took the time to add some options. You can either close tabs at
            random, close the first tab, or stop the new tab entirely until
            you decide to close it. You can also specify how many tabs you want
            to allow yourself open at one time. So stop complaining about your
            computer being slow when the problem is you can't be bothered to
            close out your tabs! Your IT department and computer friends will
            thank you when you learn that.
